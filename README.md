# ERIC (Emergency Response Information Center)

# Purpose

This app will serve as an online way to track and manage an emergency response incident.  This will initially be highly focused on Hazmat incidents because it is being developed for the Hazmat 2 Environmental Fire Rescue Company in Manheim, PA.  

# Requirements

- Developed with ICS in mind for compliance
- Must be available to be used offline and then sync back when online
    - Handling sync issues will need to be done with care when devices do come back online

# Future

The future aspirations of this app is to support all incident management scenarios and could be used for any part of an ICS-managed incident.
